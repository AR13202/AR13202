## 🛠️ Behind the Code

- I often build small side projects just to experiment with new frameworks or APIs.
- I enjoy reverse-engineering websites and apps to understand how they work.
- I love optimizing workflows — I even automated parts of my deployment process with custom scripts.
- I’m fascinated by emerging tech like WebGPU and AR, and I constantly experiment with them in my free time.
- I have a habit of turning random ideas into working prototypes — just for the fun of learning.
